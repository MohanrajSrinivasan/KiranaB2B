# MongoDB Atlas Connection Fix

## Issue
Your MongoDB connection string appears to have an incomplete cluster hostname: `cluster.mongodb.net`

## Solution
To get the correct MongoDB connection string:

1. **Go to MongoDB Atlas Dashboard**
   - Visit https://cloud.mongodb.com/
   - Log in to your account

2. **Navigate to Your Cluster**
   - Click on "Database" in the left sidebar
   - Find your cluster (should show as "Cluster0" or similar)

3. **Get Connection String**
   - Click the "Connect" button on your cluster
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string

4. **Expected Format**
   Your connection string should look like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://srirajmohan1:Y9iLhheSsniY1YL4@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/kiranacart
   ```
   Where `xxxxx` is your unique cluster identifier (usually 5 random characters)

## Common Examples
- `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.abc12.mongodb.net/database`
- `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.def34.mongodb.net/database`

## Current Status
The application is running with in-memory storage as a fallback. Once you provide the correct MongoDB URI, it will automatically switch to MongoDB.

## Testing Connection
After updating the MONGODB_URI secret, the app will restart and attempt to connect to MongoDB automatically.
